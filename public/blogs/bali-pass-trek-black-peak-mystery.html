      No words seem grandiose enough to constitute the first sentence of a blog detailing the first thru-hike blog and
      actually a "blog" in while.
      I was 22, when I did my first trek with Strangers and the world has changed irrevocably on how I view things. Fast
      forward to 2025, I was on the other side of full time job, World War III, a world economy in shambles
      and India-Pakistan War.
      
      <br><br>
      Our trek actually got postnoed amidts this war like situations. We were actually plan to do this trek in first
      week of may.
      The trek was gonna start from Dehradun, so we took bus to reach Delhi->Dehradun and WHAT HELL OF A RIDE IT WAS.

        The Music in bus has no way to stop once it started, the lower birth got hit by a random vechial early in the
        morning just before we were supposed to drop off. It was a werid yet hilarious night.
      </span>
      When we reach Dehradun we loaded our stuff in a carvan to reach Sankri via Manali from where our actual trek would
      be starting.

      Then, start our First day of walking from Sankri to Taluka to Seema (12Km) most of which was via jeep. We stated at in the
      wooden house and it was the a last time we sleeping something concrete.
      From my last trek I knew my way around the sleeping bag which I helped others too. The next day, 8KM trek from Seema to Rainbasra was through the wedgy wooden bridges
      which was very fun to cross. Shaking out my tent in the sunset, I felt increasingly giddy. Finally I was here!

       We were camped near a river, we slept there for a bit listening to the sound of 
      river.
      </span>
      
       
      
      A couple of birds (hen sized, incredibly cheeky, will look very tasty after a week or two on trail) plucked around while I sought out some shade to enjoy my lunch in. How much hotter could it get? There wasn’t a cloud in the sky, and fine clouds of dust rose from my boots kicking up the sand although it was grass and bushes all around. 
      The evening was warm, an orange hue dusted the sky. One day down,four more to go.

    </section>
<br><br><br>

Today’s stretch was almost waterless but a long 11KM stretch and I had to lug a heavy 45L bag up the undulating trail.
This put my pack weight out of my comfort zone, and I was melting under the dizzying sun. There’s a hole in the ozone layer it was confirmed that day, which is why you’ll never see sunscreen less than 30 SPF for sale. 
In other words, not the place you want to experiment with how much you can tan on day two. We had our lunch in the meadows which we packed at the start of day.We rest,hydrated and then got to know that we are still more than half way to reach todays camsite.

Then came un-expected forest trail descent which none of us were expecting.
The air was humid, and I felt like I was walking through a true rainforest. From afar we could we see our destination, so close yet so far.
It was 5PM in the evening when we first had a glance of our tent from the campsite.
We filled our bottles from the sweet water stream that was there, we changed clothes.

       We were told by the locals and the sherpas that there is lake a little above which is said to be the heightest lake at this altitude.

      I met an very intruging lady, mid 30-40. She need some help with warm water, she was from a diffrent camp who also happens to have their campsite nearby us.
      The more intresting than her was her job. She worked in National Film Archive of India, Pune. She also mentioned that the recently nationwide Guru-datt movie which was 
released, She helped it to acquire and preserve and restore which was very fasicnating to me because I am very fond of movies especially old 90's like.
Maybe a blog on my movie choices???

As the altiude was elevating , the air was getting colder. Because of the climate predication of the day when we were supposed to do the summit was told be getting worse,we were supposed to Accumulate for the day here.
Our next day was the Odhari camp which was the last campsite for us before the basecamp. It was fairly moderate trail so we covered that before noon. While on the trail we were hearing a name, "Black Peak" which is an expedition of 10=15days and is said be one of the toughest in the region.
Very few teams were able to complete that expedition this year. When we reached Odhari camp site the mist was all over the peaks, the visibilty was getting lower and lower. There was a moment when everyon left thier camps and everyone was just mesmersided by the view.

        The peak you are seeing here is the highest peak, Swargarohini I, reaching an altitude of 6,252 meters. It is renowned for its mythological significance as the "Stairway to Heaven," believed to be the path taken by the Pandavas in the epic Mahabharata.
      The legend states that Swargarohini was the only path from which a human (Only Yudhishthira, the eldest and most righteous) could reach heaven in a mortal body. Many people spent dollors to achive and complete this summit but remained unsucessful.

Met this incredible uncle (a local pahadi) during my Bali Pass trek. He's around 70 years old now, yet his eyes still shine brighter than the peaks he's climbed
He has summited Black Peak (Kalanag) not once, not twice, but 19 times. (Altitude: 6,387m) a technical peak in the Garhwal Himalayas.
But that's not the only reason this man deserves our salute.
Back in 1962, long before Instagram reels or GPS trails, he attempted something no one has achieved, The Swargarohini Peak (Altitude: 6,252m). The mythical "Stairway to Heaven." A route believed to have been taken by Yudhishthira in Mahabharata.
But this man tried it. Without a single professional certificate.
No official training. Just raw experience.
      

<br><br><br>

Now comes one last push, to the base camp which is about 14,800fts. This was a very intresting trail. It had three ridges and as you keep walking up the ascent, you will start feeling out of breath. Addentionaly, there were
Debries with our tent and stuff which was making it even more hard. The air was getting thinner and it was getting cold.

Me and my roommate decided to hit push-ups. and YES it was 15KG bag on my back.
      </span>

<br><br><br>

After all this, after coming all this far my body decided to on its own that lets do something crazy. How about we vomit? I puked like crazy all the water i had on the way all the hydration all gone.
And we have to wake up early for the summit tommorow moring i.e we would be starting the trek at 3-4AM in morning. The temperate at night drops below 0C. Glad we had proper Clothing. After resting,I was feeling a bit better
so we decided to have dinner early and sleep for the next day.

THE DAY arrvies, we get all geared up 3AM in the morning for the summit. All other team have already starting the trail to summit. It was all snow. W started slow and
slowly get to our pace. There was a 60 Old retired army officer and his Wife they both were climbing the summit as it was a normal day in park for them lol.
<br><br><br>
The first sun ray hits the snow and its all white, as far as the eye can see ALL White. And we were at the summit.
Reaching the top of the pass high on adrenaline surpassed every award I’d ever earned. Climbing this summit had taken approx hour, but somehow also a years since I’d first discovered about the bali pass . The journey spanned across a whole universe of existence. All of us whooped with joy, hugging each other and celebrating with chocolate and selfies. Right there and then we were the coolest people in the world.  
<figure>
        <img src="../assets/images/balipass/0_16.jpg" width="600" height="400" loading="lazy" />

  While everyone was recording and cherring to each other clicking pics, I was at the summit vommiting again.
  My stomach was not at all feeling good. Still Managed to sneak myself in the team summit photo hehee. Just as we done with all this,
  Our death was awaiting us. We were assuming that desecnt will be easy but that was not the case. WE WERE AT THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN AND THE ONLY WAY GO DOWN WAS VIA THOSE SLIPPERY ROCK.
  The whole descent trail (there was no trail AT ALL...) we were holding to our lives, one miss step and we fall to death. (Quite exciting tho xD). I was still feeling nauseous, so I took some ORS chugged in and told the sherpa that I will be going as far as I can.
  I ran down the hill, I was all alone for 10 mins , I had lost the trail which the sherpa showed me.
<br><br><br>
  Fortunatily , I saw some choclate wrappers somewhere near the rock, other trekkers might have halted there for a break, and soon after following that I saw that 60 old Army officer. I took a breath of relif. But the rush I felt during that sprint and being alone was soo exciting at so many levels I cant explain.
Then I also see few other groups resting, talked with them exchanged water bottles and start following the trail again.
I reached a bit early ,around 1PM noon. Enroute there was slight network access too, so I sit quitly for 30 mins and just danced and though to myself "This is where life is" ,before hading to the camps which I can see afar in the forest which was our camp site after the summit was done i.e Lower Damani.
Remeber I told you about the bad weather. My other team trek memmber got stuck in rain and that took them almost 2-3 hours to cover the same trail. They all were dranched in rain when the got back to the camps.
The following day we were met the carvan driver to get back to Dehradun. It was soo
It was the end of an threlliering advantuer for all of us, we learned something about ourselves and other who were with you on the same trail.

      No words seem grand enough to open a blog about my first thru-hike—and actually my first “blog” in a while.
      I was 22 when I did my first trek with strangers, and the way I saw the world changed irrevocably. Fast

      Our trek actually got postponed amidst these war-like situations. We had planned to do it in the first
      week of May. The trek was starting from Dehradun, so we took a bus from Delhi to Dehradun—and WHAT A RIDE IT WAS.
      <label for="sn-anything" class="sidenote-toggle"></label>
      <input id="sn-anything" class="sidenote-toggle" />

        The bus music had no off switch once it started, and the lower berth got hit by a random vehicle early in the
        morning just before we were supposed to get off. Weird yet hilarious night.

      When we reached Dehradun, we loaded our stuff into a caravan to reach Sankri (via Manali), where our actual trek would
      start.

    I met a very intriguing lady in her mid-30s to 40s who needed warm water. She was from a different camp nearby.
    Even more interesting than her request was her job: she worked at the National Film Archive of India, Pune.
    She mentioned that the recently re-released Guru Dutt film was acquired, preserved, and restored with her help—which fascinated me because I love movies, especially old ’90s ones. Maybe a blog on my movie choices soon?

      My roommate and I decided to do push-ups. With a 15 kg bag on my back. Because why not.
    </span>


    After all this, my body decided to add its own plot twist: how about we vomit?
    I puked like crazy—there went all the water and electrolytes. And we had to wake up early for the summit the next morning; we were starting at 3–4 AM. The temperature at night dipped below 0°C. Thankfully, we had proper clothing. After some rest, I felt a bit better.
    We had an early dinner and tried to sleep.

    THE DAY arrives. We geared up at 3 AM. Other teams had already started. It was all snow.
    We started slow and found our pace. A 60-year-old retired Army officer and his wife were climbing the summit like it was a casual morning walk in the park (power couple energy).

    The first sunray hit the snow and suddenly everything was white—as far as the eye could see. And we were at the summit.
    Reaching the top of the pass, high on adrenaline, surpassed every award I’ve ever earned. Climbing had taken about an hour, but somehow also years since I first learned about Bali Pass.
    The journey spanned a whole universe of existence. We whooped with joy, hugged, and celebrated with chocolate and selfies. For a moment, we were the coolest people in the world.

    While everyone was recording and cheering, I was at the summit vomiting again.
    My stomach wasn’t thrilled. I still managed to sneak into the team summit photo, though. Then came our fate: we assumed the descent would be easy. It wasn’t. WE WERE AT THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN, AND THE ONLY WAY DOWN WAS OVER SLIPPERY ROCK.
    There was basically no trail. We were holding on for dear life—one misstep and it could’ve gone very wrong. (Quite exciting, though. xD)
    I still felt nauseous, so I chugged some ORS and told the sherpa I’d go as far as I could.
    I ran downhill and was alone for 10 minutes—I’d lost the line the sherpa showed me.

    Fortunately, I saw some chocolate wrappers near a rock—other trekkers must’ve rested there—and soon after, I spotted that 60-year-old Army officer. Relief.
    The rush I felt during that solo sprint was…a lot. Then I saw a few other groups resting, exchanged water bottles, and followed the route again.
    I reached a bit early—around 1 PM. En route, there was a slight network signal, so I sat quietly for 30 minutes, danced a little, and thought, “This is where life is,” before heading to the forest campsite we could see afar—Lower Damini.
    Remember that bad weather? The rest of my team got stuck in the rain; it took them 2–3 hours longer to cover the same stretch. They were drenched when they got back.

    The following day, we met our caravan driver and headed back to Dehradun. And just like that, it ended:
    a thrilling adventure where each of us learned something about ourselves—and about the people walking beside us.
